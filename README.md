### üíª Tech Stacks

We work with powerful, in-demand technologies to ensure you're learning the most relevant skills.

| Category | Core Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Web Development** | MERN Stack (`MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `React.js`, `Node.js`) |
| **Mobile Development** | `React Native` |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Jenkins`, `GitLab CI/CD`, `AWS` |
| **Backend & AI** | `Python`, `Django`, `Flask`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` |
| **Databases** | `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL` |

### ‚ú® My Preferred Stack

While all these technologies are valuable, my personal favorite and a great starting point for aspiring developers is the **MERN Stack**.

Here's why I prefer it:
* **JavaScript Everywhere:** Use a single language for both the frontend and backend, which simplifies learning and project development.
* **Strong Community:** React.js has a massive community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
* **Versatility:** The MERN stack is incredibly versatile, perfect for everything from simple websites to complex web applications.
